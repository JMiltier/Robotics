# Object and Line Follow
Sparki goes on an adventure! Sparki rotates until an object is found (or placed) within 30cm of it's dual frontal ultrasound sensor, then advances to the object, and securing it with it's two forward clamps. Sparki then does a 180 degree turn, and drives until it finds a line* to travel along. At that point, Sparki will continue to follow the line until reach the starting marker. At this point, Sparki stops, drops the object, rotates 180 degrees, and does a little dance while a Mario tune is played (in 8-bit fashion).

*Note: the line is part of the line-following map that came with the Sparki kit.
